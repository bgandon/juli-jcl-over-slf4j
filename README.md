JULI-dedicated jcl-over-slf4j library
-------------------------------------

This project is a solution for using SLF4J and Logback as Tomcat internal
logging system.

This is highly inspirated by [tomcat-slf4j-logback](https://github.com/grgrzybek/tomcat-slf4j-logback).

It aims at building an additional library that plugs into the
_tomcat-extras-juli_ component to provide SLF4J logging with the Logback
backend, without modifying the _tomcat-extras-juli_ library. (On the contrary,
[tomcat-slf4j-logback](https://github.com/grgrzybek/tomcat-slf4j-logback)
builds a smaller library using a subset of the _default_ tomcat-juli jar.)

This lib provides:

1. A bridge from the full JCL implementation of _tomcat-extras-juli_ and SLF4J.

2. Package-renamed SLF4J & Logback libraries, so that they might not conflict
   with any SLF4J & Logback that would ship with web applications.

Web application that ship their own SLF4J & Logback libraries will properly
create separate logging contexts. This is the [simple approach](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/loggingSeparation.html#easy).
The `conf/logback-catalina.xml` shall use the package-renamed code, prepending
the `com.apache.juli` to all Logback slass names. JNDI cannot be setup since
Logback intializes before the JNDI system is ready.


Caveat
------

The default `org.apache.juli.logging.LogFactory` is not suppressed from the
original `tomcat-extras-juli.jar`. It is just masked by the one provided by
`tomcat-extras-juli-over-slf4j.jar`. This might not be portable because JVM
implementations bring no guraranty as per the loading order of classes on the
classpath.


Setup
-----

1. Build the lib

```
mvn clean package
```

2. Copy the resulting `target/tomcat-extras-juli-over-slf4j-1.7.12.jar` to the
   `$CATALINA_BASE/bin/` directory.

3. Add the Bash code below to your `$CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.sh` script.

```bash
# Logging configuration
# Because the juli config needs to be set early at bootstrap time

# Deactivate standard JULI config (the correct way by Bugzilla #45585)
LOGGING_CONFIG="-Dnop"

# Add bridge to the class path
CLASSPATH="${CLASSPATH:+$CLASSPATH:}$CATALINA_BASE"/bin/tomcat-extras-juli-over-slf4j-1.7.12.jar

# Activate diagnostics in LogFactory of 'tomcat-extras-juli'
# Actually non are output because the original JULI LogFactory is masked
# by the one provided by 'juli-jcl-over-slf4j' above
CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -Dorg.apache.juli.logging.diagnostics.dest=STDOUT"

# Setup config file
CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -Djuli.logback.configurationFile=$CATALINA_BASE/conf/logback-catalina.xml"
```

4. Remove the default `$CATALINA_BASE/conf/logging.properties` because it's no
   use keeping it anymore.

5. Restart Tomcat.
